# analyze

The `analyze` command is used to scan additional repos to detect components and analyze their dependencies _after_ you've gone through the initial setup with `init`.

## Options

### `-i` / `--include`

By default, `analyze` takes the current directory as the root and analyzes everything. Supplying a glob pattern to `-i` narrows where to scan for components. You can pass multiple glob patterns:

```sh
npx @omlet/cli analyze -i 'glob/one' -i 'glob/two'
```

```sh
yarn dlx @omlet/cli analyze -i 'glob/one' -i 'glob/two'
```

```sh
pnpm dlx @omlet/cli analyze -i 'glob/one' -i 'glob/two'
```

### `--ignore`

Pass a glob pattern for any directory, file, or component you want Omlet CLI to ignore. You can pass multiple `--ignore` patterns:

```sh
npx @omlet/cli analyze --ignore 'glob/one' --ignore 'glob/two'
```

```sh
yarn dlx @omlet/cli analyze --ignore 'glob/one' --ignore 'glob/two'
```

```sh
pnpm dlx @omlet/cli analyze --ignore 'glob/one' --ignore 'glob/two'
```

> **Note**
>
> Glob patterns are applied against the file path relative to the project's root directory:
>
> - `*` matches zero or more characters (excluding path separators).
> - `?` matches any single character (excluding path separators).
> - `**` recursively matches directories.
>
> See the [Pattern in glob](https://docs.rs/glob/latest/glob/struct.Pattern.html) documentation for details.

### `-r` / `--root`

Set where Omlet CLI will run the analysis. Useful if you're running the CLI from a different directory than the project you want to scan.

By default, the project root is the current working directory. If that directory doesn't contain a `package.json`, the CLI walks up the directory hierarchy until it finds one.

The CLI prints the resolved root in the terminal:

```shell-session
Analyzing the project at <PATH>…
```

### `--log-level`

Specify the log level for the CLI. Possible values: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`.

### `-v` / `--verbose`

Default: `false`. Adds detailed log output in the CLI.

### `--dry-run`

Scanned results are output locally to `omlet.out.json` only — nothing is uploaded. Useful for inspecting results before sending them to the web app.

### `-h` / `--help`

`omlet analyze -h` prints all available options with explanations.
